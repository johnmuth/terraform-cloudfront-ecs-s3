# terraform-cloudfront-ecs-s3

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to manage a bunch of AWS infrastructure for hosting a webapp.

The main thing I wanted to figure out was how to set up Cloudfront to route traffic to a webapp and to an S3 bucket, 
depending on the path.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- Docker
- Terraform
